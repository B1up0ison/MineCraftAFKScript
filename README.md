# MineCraft AFK Script
This is a simple AFK script that allows you to leave your PC while you farm away. The script utilizes mouse movement to stimulate sleeping, halving the total AFK time needed to farm.

This script runs ideal when standing on top of a bed. The camera should automatically correct itself before each sleep session.

This specific script is designed for iron farming, netting an average of 300 iron per hour, however, it can be customized by changing the right-click functionality to the left for example in the case of an XP farm.

By incorporating sleep, mob attacks from phantoms are mitigated in addition to being able to run the farm 24/7 as iron golems do not spawn during nighttime.

A typical Minecraft day is around ~650 seconds in real life, this script runs every ~325 seconds to stimulate movement to run correctly. Testing done around ~540 to 650 seconds rendered the script to be inconsistent, a potential fix would be the introduction of gradual gradual movements. One added benefit of running this script for roughly a half day in Minecraft is that you can easily launch Minecraft and this script and leave it alone as it will automatically synchronize during nighttime.
