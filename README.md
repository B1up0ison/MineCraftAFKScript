# MineCraftAFKScript
This is a simple AFK script that allows you to leave your PC while you farm away. The script utilizes mouse movement to stimulate sleeping, thereby halving the total AFK time needed.

A typical Minecraft day is around ~650 seconds in real life, this script runs every ~325 seconds to stimulate movement to run correctly. Testing done around ~540 to 650 seconds rendered the script to be inconsistent

This script runs ideal when standing on top of a bed. The camera should automatically correct itself prior to each sleep session.
